## [ How To Use Injector ? ] 

- make sure you enable Hyper-V support in bios
some motherboards will name it differently so please look up before using

make sure your dll is in the same folder 
**re-name** your dll to **test.dll** if not it wont inject
**the dll must be in the same folder**
-  **Open the injector -> then type out your game**
-  **hit enter key after you have typed it out**
- wait around 10-20 seconds for it to initalize


## Supports Intel + Amd Cpu's

## Injection methods 
- Manual Map
- load libary
- x86 / x64 support
- APC Injection
- SetWindowsHook ( uses window class name to inject )
- Hyper-Visor
- RWX Injection


## Injection - > extra information
- CreateRemoteThread
- NtCreateThreadEx
- RtlCreateUserThread
- Delayed Injection ( choose how long you want to delay it for in )
- Changes Started Thread's Start Address
- Create Threads + Detours can be used within your dll
- Clears Loaded Module's PE Headers
- Changes Started Thread's Start Address



# other stuff
- Simple Display Of Imports Found From File
- Information Displayed: RVA, Original First Thunk, Name Of Module, Name Of Imported Function ( Remember that this is being parsed through file, not through running process )

# process 
- Simple Table For Processes
- Info Displayed: PID, EXE Name, Window Name, Ram Used and Full Path
- Allows You To Switch To NtQueryVirtualMemory For Checking Loaded Modules


## Requirements
- C++ Redistributables 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 

# Remote code execution
- Execute functions in remote process
- Assemble own code and execute it remotely
- Support for cdecl/stdcall/thiscall/fastcall conventions
- Support for arguments passed by value, pointer or reference, including structures
- FPU types are supported
- Execute code in new thread or any existing one



##  BENIFITS THAT COME WITH BUYING PRIVATE SOURCE CODE?
- the source code is not public version it will be a completely undetected injector + driver along with a custom mapper allowing you to bypass vangaurd + faceit blocking methods 

- UI Mode ( imgui mode of the injector )
- dump games + the game pdb ( some games dont work )
- you can use detours + minhook
- decrypt offsets ( rainbow 6, warzone )
- dump offsets for all titles
- choose what injection format you want x86 / x64
- IAT dumper
- cheat engine support + other debuggers
- offset dumper
- Dump EAC + BE
- edit packets / spoof packets
- inject without any detections
- Anti-Cheat Emulator ( allowing you to do play without running anti-cheat )
- have a full private source code ( fully undetected + Secure source code )


## Questions ?
- Q: does it work for all games | A: yes this does works for all games 
- Q: can i create threads in my dll? | A: Yes since we emulate anticheats with this injector you can create threads
- Q: Is there a risk of me using this ? | A: Of course there is as anything public can become detected
